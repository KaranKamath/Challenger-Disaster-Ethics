RIGHTS ETHICS

Action:
Morton Thiokol recommending the launch of Challenger to proceed, noting "Lund (of Thiokol) reversed his previous decision and recommended that the launch proceed."

Party 1 - Morton Thiokol:
Morton&ndash;Thiokol satisfied their right to ensure business.

Party 2 - NASA:
Morton Thiokol violated NASA's right to get a clear picture of the problem by not conducting enough tests in varied weather conditions. The lack of data under cold conditions led NASA to conclude that there was no "proof of danger".


Action:
NASA did not want to postpone the launch, noting "NASA didn’t want to antagonize [Vice-President] Bush, a strong NASA supporter, by postponing the launch due to inclement weather after he had arrived."

Party 1 - Morton Thiokol:
NASA's violated Morton Thiokol's right to object freely and stop the launch by pressuring and intimidating them.

"During the conference call, Hardy told Thiokol, "I am appalled. I am appalled by your recommendation." Mulloy said, "My God, Thiokol, when do you want me to launch — next April?"" - Wikipedia

Party 2:
NASA satisfied their right to ensure the survival of the space shuttle program and stay ahead in the Space Race.

"NASA also felt pressure to get the Challenger launched on time so that the next shuttle launch, which was to carry a probe to examine Halley’s comet, would be launched before a Russian probe designed to do the same thing" - FLEDDERMANN

"NASA
was feeling some urgency in the program because the European Space Agency was
developing what seemed to be a cheaper alternative to the shuttle, which could
potentially put the shuttle out of business" - FLEDDERMANN

"NASA’s budget was determined by Congress, which was becoming increasingly unhappy with delays in the shuttle project and shuttle performance." - FLEDDERMANN
